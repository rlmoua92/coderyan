# codeRyan

This application is based on the popular board game Code Names. A board of words is pseudo-randomly generated and each team is assigned a number of those words. Only the Spymaster of each team knows which words belong to their team and gives clues to try and get their team to guess those words. The first team to guess all of their wordsd wins.
